# SunnyBot
A Discord bot that tries to help improve mental health and cheer up a few people. Inspired by the increasing amount of those struggling with mental health issues, we were motivated to try to create a bot that would help alleviate some stress. We chose to create a Discord bot because Discord is a huge and popular platform, used by many. It is easily accessible for anyone who uses Discord. Being beginners, we struggled to implement anything too advanced in the given time limit but we managed to create something cohesive with basic features. In the future, we are aiming to be able to store user specific data.
